PEAK PERFORMANCE HABITS
FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS:
The 7 Simple Habits I Developed To Become A 7 Figure Developer
John Z. Sonmez

INTRODUCTION
When I coach software developers... I generally see the same
problems over and over again.
Problems like:
● Being overstressed because of looming deadlines
● How they never have free time to spend with family and friends
● Often stuck in the same job for years without any progress
● Never having enough energy due to many sleepless nights
● Not sure how to keep up with new technology
● Easily overwhelmed so they procrastinate all day
● And much more...
90% of the time... these problems happen because developers rely on
motivation, willpower and feelings way too much.
Which greatly shapes their mindset and has a huge affect on their
everyday action.
(I’ll explain why in just a moment...)
You see, I was in the same boat...
One day — I would feel motivated and ready to tackle anything life
could throw at me.
But then I’d have days where all I wanted to do was play video games
for 8 hours straight.
I thought to myself...
“How is there such a huge gap? And why does it happen so often?”
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|1

So I started to search for ways to beat it...
I tried hacks to double my productivity. I tried apps to track my
progress. I tried all the cool new routines everyone talked about. But
after trying one tactic after another... I found they only give temporary
results.
It never stuck with me.
And I would fall back into the same old routine. Except now I felt
worse because nothing was working.
Well after years of trial and error. After reading countless books and
studies. And after listening to the best experts on productivity.
After years of testing literally everything in the market...
I found it has nothing to do with tractics.
In fact, it has a lot to do with our mindsets and habits. This was the
root cause and I was failing to address it.
But once I cracked the code...
I FULLY RETIRED BY THE AGE OF 33
I had more money than any of my peers around me..
I didn’t have to work for anyone unless I wanted to.
I ditched the golden handcuffs and won my time back.
And now — I can do what I want, when I want.
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|2

Freedom — more important than all the money I made...
Which brings this to you... but before we start I’d like to say...
Thank you for reading this document.
This could be the most important thing you read as a software
developer.
Why?
Because it will allow you to improve your life — in ways you probably
never even thought of...
I’M GOING TO SHARE... HOW I BECAME A 7 FIGURE
DEVELOPER IN LESS THAN 5 YEARS
All with the power of habits and mindset...
I know it might sound crazy now but keep reading...
And believe me... this won't be the typical:
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|3

“How to get a job at a FAANG company”
Or
“How to pass your coding interview” lessons.
There’s a lot of resources out there already.
Though with these habits and mindset shifts... you’ll be able to
accomplish those tasks easily.
For now... this quick document will focus on how you can get way
MORE from life as a software developer.
Way more happiness from your work. And not have it feel like a drain
on your existence.
Way more time to enjoy yourself. And not have work be the only thing
in your life.
Way more freedom to pursue your purpose in life. And not have to
fear — whether you’ll make it or not.
All you need to do is copy these 7 simple proven habits I’ve developed
and perfected over the years.
So let’s get right into it...
1
TURN SYSTEMS INTO HABITS
You know what’s funny?
Developers often work on complex systems. They can take ideas and
turn them into software...
But when it comes to their own lives and habits...
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|4

All common sense goes out the window.
It’s like watching your best friend date the worst possible partner. But
he doesn’t realize it.
You see, what most people do is marry themselves to goals...
And not even SMART goals... specific, measurable, achievable,
realistic, and time bound...
BUT LET’S BE REAL HONEST HERE... MOST
PEOPLE SET PRETTY BAD GOALS
Here’s some I hear often:
● I want to make 1 million dollars
● I want to buy a property
● I want to lose weight
● I want a girlfriend
● I want to work at Google, Facebook, Apple etc.
● I want passive income
● And many more...
This is great and all — but here’s where I have to be a little harsh...
These goals don't matter...
These are aspirations.
It would be great to have all those things above wouldn't it?
Of course it would.
But what's the plan? You have no idea where to start or what action to
take. You have no idea how long you should take. And it doesn't feel
achievable.
Which brings me over to my next point...
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|5

YOU HAVE ZERO CONTROL OVER THESE
OUTCOMES
Sure, it would be great to make a million dollars by 33. But
realistically... you have no control over this outcome.
There’s so many factors at play...
Like how the market changes and all of a sudden you can’t make any
sales. Or how natural disasters can turn everything on its head. Or
maybe Facebook decides to ban you from their platform for no reason.
There will always be factors out of your control.
And look I’m not saying it isn't possible. If a geek like me can do it. I
know others like you can.
But you must approach your dreams the right way.
Which goes well with my next point...
YOUR GOALS WILL CHANGE
Your feelings WILL change.
And your motivations WILL change...
I'm sure a lot of young developers dream of traveling the world —
while working on their laptop on some foregin beach — then go crazy
and party at night with the locals.
Is this something you want to be doing forever?
For some it will be... for others — priorities change...
All of a sudden waking up to a hangover — while you have a deadline
at noon — isn’t so appealing anymore.
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|6

And maybe cleaning urine off your ceiling isn’t the best use of your
time or skills.
So to reiterate...
Your goals can change at a moment's notice. Your motivation can take
a nosedive for almost any reason.
You can feel like not working anymore... you can get discouraged for
not reaching your goal fast enough.
Then what? You quit? Burn out?
Move onto the next shiny object?
Instead, I want you to do this...
CREATE SYSTEMS TO MOVE YOURSELF
FORWARD...
Systems are stronger than goals because they create habits. Habits
last longer. And habits happen automatically.
I plan out my week and use systems/methods like the Pomodoro method
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|7

For example... Let's say you want to write a book (like I did many
times).
Here’s how the process might look:
● Step 1: Wake up 1 hour earlier than normal
● Step 2: Turn on your Pomodoro timer
● Step 3: Write chapter 1 outline
● Step 4: Write chapter 1 without editing
● Step 5: Edit chapter 1 for mistakes
Then repeat this process for chapter 2 and so on...
It’s a lot less intimidating when you only have to write one chapter a
day. And much easier to follow a basic system like this...
...Then to stress and worry about a whole book.
Now apply/create systems to other aspects of your life.
Create the habit of well... creating habits (systems) and your output
will explode.
Take Action:
● Create a system for one of your goals
● Remember: Aspiration -> Goal -> Process -> System
● Example of a system: Create 1 YouTube video a week.
Step 1: Write outline for video
Step 2: Turn on Camera and audio recorder
Step 3: Create content and hit every note on outline
Step 4: Sync audio with video
Step 5: Edit and cut out useless footage
Step 6: Edit in effects and enhancements
Step 7: Upload video to YouTube
Step 8: Write descriptions and proper tags
Step 9: Publish the damn thing
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|8

2
TRUST THE PROCESS
Do you second guess yourself all the time?
Want to know why it’s so hard to get results?
Eager to get long term results quicker?
Well, stick around for this one...
You see, most developers just go about their day randomly...
They’ll code for 30 minutes... then check Facebook for 40 minutes.
They’ll answer an email... then check the latest news.
And then send funny memes on slack. Then complain to their friends
about the project managers (the ones with CS degrees and never
have written a line of code)...
It’s no wonder so many developers work late.
The whole day is one distraction after another. There’s no real process
to it.
So at the end of the day, you’re frustrated and stressed — trying to
squeeze in all your high priority duties.
Which leaves you and wondering...
“Am I as good as I say I am? And why can’t I deliver results faster?”
Sounds familiar..?
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|9

WELL IF YOU WANT LONG TERM SUCCESS... AND
WANT REAL RESULTS
You have to change up your work habits... You have to trust the
process FRIST.
You see, most people have this backwards...
They focus on the results FIRST.
But this is a waste of time...
For example, many developers complain about how...
● They aren't getting enough views on their YouTube channel.
● No one is reading their blog posts
● Not losing enough weight
● Not making enough money at their job
But just like their work life... they just go about it randomly.
So typically, they get discouraged and just quit. With no real results to
show. Nothing changes. And their life remains the same.
Well, except... when they move onto the next shiny object and repeat
this process all over again.
Which brings me to my next point...
YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THE RESULTS.
ONLY THE PROCESS
It’s like playing a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role playing
game)...
Let’s say you want to reach the max level for your character. Which is
level 100 in this case...
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|10

All you have to do is follow the process until you reach the end goal. It
makes sense to play one character until it reaches max level.
Makes sense right?
But here’s what most developers do...
They play one character until level 20.
Then they complain it’s taking way too long. So they create another
character and raise it to level 30.
Then try another character to level 25.
(Replace character with skills)
Until they have 5 different characters all at different levels...
But none of the characters are at the max level of 100.
Not very efficient is it?
But I get it... starting a new character and learning new skills is fun
and exciting.
Everything is new. You’re making exponential gains in skill. And
progress seems to come faster.
But it’s all an illusion.
Because if you just trust the process and get one character to reach
the endgame....
You can have fun doing the BEST content. The endgame raids and
most lucrative dungeons.
Get the coolest gear and show off to your guildmates.
(Because no one cares if you have a bunch of low level characters...
but people WILL listen when you have legendary gear)
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|11

Alright, enough of my game examples...
SO HOW DO YOU DEVELOP THE HABIT OF
TRUSTING THE PROCESS?
First, you have to figure out what you want to accomplish — and
create a process around it.
For example:
Do you want 100K people to read your blog every month? Well, looks
like you need to write 1 blog post a week (at least).
Do you want to lose 15 pounds to impress your mom? Better come up
with a diet and workout routine (process).
Do you want to make 10K a month from freelance clients? You better
have a good prospecting process.
Next, you MUST train yourself and believe the results don’t matter.
This will be the toughest part to get over... but it will make such a
huge difference in your career/life.
Trust me when I tell you... it frees you. You become less stressed.
And you’ll be much happier overall as a person...
RESULTS DON’T MATTER BECAUSE WHAT REALLY
MATTERS — IS WHO YOU BECOME IN THE
PROCESS
Look I’m going to be real with you here...
I didn't feel fulfilled once I made 1 million dollars.
Honestly it felt like any other Tuesday.
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|12

I didn’t all of a sudden become confident — because I achieved 6
pack abs.
Sure, it was nice to look at for a while. But then it was back to
business again.
And I wasn't “a big shot” because I landed an interview at Microsoft.
Nope, felt the same on the inside.
But when I look at my journey and see what I became... when I look in
the mirror and see how much I’ve changed.
When I think about all the people I've helped throughout my career. All
the lives I’ve changed and things I was able to experience.
Before and after transformation. Just like our bodies... we must train our minds.
Trust the process.
I’m proud and grateful.
This is a feeling you can't put a price on.
So divorce yourself from the results and trust the process.
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|13

Take Action:
● Figure out what your goal is
● Create a process and have it lead to your goal
● Follow this process for a set amount of time
● Evaluate the results and see where you can improve it
● Continue to iterate the process
● Execute and trust the process

HOW YOU LIVE ONE DAY IS HOW
YOU LIVE EVERYDAY
Do you know you can't stick to one thing for a long time?
And do you know why you procrastinate way too much?
Well, it has to do with how you live your everyday life...
Now, I’m not trying to make you feel bad. I was in the same boat as
most people...
Sure, I got some tasks done. But I knew deep down I could do way
more. That I should be making more money. And have more time to
myself.
I knew all of this... but I still slacked off and waited until the last
minute.
And I would do everything in my power to NOT work.
But then I started to notice something bad... my work habits
transferred to other areas of my life.
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|14

My health was pretty bad because I ate garbage all the time. And I
never felt like working out.
I didn’t have any real friends — mostly acquaintances from work. I
didn’t want to put in the effort to date or meet people.
After work, I would just play games and do nothing...
And this led to a very mediocre life...
I WAS MERELY EXISTING
Until I discovered what was wrong with me...
You see, how you do one thing is how you do EVERYthing in your life.
In simpler terms... if you’re sloppy and lazy at work. It’s going to
transfer to EVERY area of your life.
Your relationships, health, career, hobbies, etc.
Think of it this way...
Let’s say you’re on a diet and want to lose 5 - 10 pounds.
Well, you see a nice bag of Doritos lying around on the counter.
You tell yourself:
“Ah it won't hurt to eat this whole bag... it’s just this one time.”
Unfortunately, it’s not just one time...
IF YOU MAKE THE CHOICE NOW — IT’S LIKELY TO
HAPPEN AGAIN
It will repeat itself in the future...
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|15

And of course this applies to more than your diet.
If you physically get angry because your code won’t compile... It’s
going to happen again.
If you get emotionally unstable — because your computer crashed for
the 4th time today?
It will happen again.
You get the point... and to summarize.
What does your ideal day look like? What actions can you take NOW — to make
everyday your ideal day?
The more you do something... the easier it becomes to make the
same decision over and over again.
In fact, you’re reinforcing the pathways in your brain to respond and
act in this way...
THIS IS HOW WE DEVELOP GOOD AND BAD HABITS
So here’s what to do to change your bad habits...
First, I want you to reframe your mind and think differently...
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|16

Every choice you make — either continues an old pattern or starts a
new one.
Next, I want you to think about how this pattern will affect you in the
long term.
The cumulative result of this action...
For example: Like how you brush your teeth everyday.
(At least I hope you brush your teeth regularly...)
You brush your teeth so you won't be sucking meat smoothies through
a straw — when you're 50 years old.
And finally... I want you to create rules for what you DON’T want to
happen...
Don’t want to drop dead from a heart attack at 45?
Make a rule saying you won’t eat any fast food on the way home from
work.
Don't want women to reject you because you’re toothless?
Make a rule to brush your teeth twice a day.
Don’t want to waste your potential and the best years of your life?
Create a rule saying you only get to play games — when you finish 8
Pomodoros.
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|17

Your actions echo forward through time. It’s all about cumulative gains.
And remember... you don’t have to start off perfect. You’ll make
mistakes and it’s OK.
When you fall off the wagon — keep going and don’t quit.
Because if you start to make the right choices over and over again...
you’ll start to gain momentum. And all the good habits will start to
stick.
Build them up over time — and commit to them everyday.
This is the secret to long term success in ALL areas of your life.
Take Action:
● Assume you will be weaker tomorrow
● Create an ideal day (what does your best day look like)
● Follow your ideal day model as best you can
● Learn to delay gratification (do it later instead of quitting)
● Example: Say you’ll eat pizza later — after you’re done with
your workout
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|18

YOU WIN OR YOU LEARN
Are you scared of being wrong?
Does failure scare you?
Don’t worry, you’re not alone...
In fact, there’s a big stigma in our culture around failure.
A lot of people (and especially developers) can't stand being wrong.
They can’t stand any hint of failure. They will go out of their way to
avoid it...
Like some guy dressed in an animal fursuit at a convention. You kind
of hope it goes away and no one notices.
And once again I’m not calling you out or anything...
(Dress up however you want)
I call things how I see it. And I’m not going to give you some BS
answer to make you feel better.
I’m here to give you real solutions.
Anyways, back to dealing with failure... I’m going to give you 2
reasons why we actually fail in a moment.
But first, realize this way of thinking causes developers to never grow
— and remain stuck for decades.
But here’s the truth...
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|19

THERE’S NO WAY AROUND FAILURE
It will happen to you.
It happens to me all the time.
And It happens to every successful person known to mankind.
But guess what... it’s OK
So drill this into your brain... Everyone fails.
You don’t know — what you don't know after all.
(In fact, you HAD to fail — to bring it up in your awareness)
And the reason why everyone gets so bent out of shape — is because
of expectations.
(I’ll go deeper into expectations later)
So instead of punching your monitor because you messed up a
project. Or because you said something stupid during a meeting...
I challenge you to think of failure in this way instead...
You either learn or you win...
Let’s say you have to fight a very
challenging boss in a video game.
Think about the hardest boss you ever
faced.(Like a boss from Dark Souls or M.
Bison from Street Fighter)
If you win... you get what you want.
You beat the boss... level up and reap the rewards.
This is the easy part — since Everyone likes to win.
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|20

But let’s say this boss beats you down.
So what do you do about it?
Do you cry and complain? Do you say it ain’t fair and whine? Do you
go back home and become a family man?
No, you fight him again.
And everytime you lose, you get closer to beating him. You’re learning
his moves. You learn more about the timing of his attacks.
You start to figure out his patterns.
And your fingers react faster and faster each time.
Every death gets you closer and closer... you’re learning more and
more.
Until you beat it... this is how success really works...
IT’S RARE YOU GET THINGS PERFECT THE VERY
FIRST TIME
But let’s say you fight the boss over and over again...
...But you DON”T learn anything new.
You’ve wasted your time and got frustrated for no reason.
This is when you’ve truly failed.
So when you run into a roadblock at work. Or maybe your gym gains
aren’t where you want it to be...
Or nothing seems to be going right for you...don’t worry about it.
Trust the process...
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|21

AND REALIZE THERE'S ONLY TWO MAIN REASONS
WHY YOU “FAILED”
Reason #1: It’s a lack of knowledge... you don't know what you don't
know.
How can you succeed if you have
no idea how to do it?
In this case it’s your job to find out
how. To gain more knowledge
about the challenge.
And reason #2 is a lack of
discipline...
In this case you know exactly what to do... but for some reason you’re
just not doing it.
Could be you’re lazy, afraid, tired, blocked etc.
Find the reason why you can’t act on your knowledge. And get the
block out of the way.
Remember —  you can only win or learn...
Take Action:
● It’s OK to fail —  don’t beat yourself up over mistakes
● Think of failure as a way to learn or get more data
● Understand failure is necessary and unavoidable
● Don't be afraid to fail often... it can lead to new discoveries
● Remember only two reasons for “failure” : A lack of
knowledge or a lack of discipline.

TACTICAL BLUEPRINT TO
DOUBLE YOUR PRODUCTIVITY
In a 4 year time span — I became a millionaire...
And this was from the ages of 29 to 33.
Almost hard to believe right?
Well, this is when I started the Simple Programmer blog. I also created
courses, developper books, the Simple Programmer channel and at
the same time I ramped up my real estate investments.
Now when I think about it... it’s weird how fast it happened.
I owe it all to one simple thing really...
I became more productive during those years. And I followed a
process.
I kept banging on the drum until I got what I wanted.
It’s funny, when you stop being lazy... The amount you can
accomplish in 1 year is amazing.
And we often underestimate what we can accomplish in 1 - 4 years.
In this section I want to share with you my exact process so you can
double your productivity.
Just copy this blueprint and you’ll be amazed at how much you can
get done.
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|23

Part 1: Create the plan
My basic flow goes like this...
It’s easier to get more done when you have everything planned out like above
1. I plan my whole week out with Kanbanflow (You can use Excel
or any type of data sheet)
2. Make each column a day of the week (Example: Column 1 is
Monday, column 2 is Tuesday etc)
Today:MondayTuesday
Record 1 Video (2 PD)
Write 1 Blog Post (2 PD)
3. Then I break down each task into how many Pomodoros they
will take (Example: Reply to emails will take 1 Pomodoro)
Quick break: What is the Pomodoro method?
Pomodoro is a time management method (system). You focus on
one task in 25 minutes blocks — then take a quick 5 minute break.
After 2 Pomodoros blocks (50 minutes). You can take a longer 10
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|24

minute break .
You repeat this process until you finish all your tasks. Or until you
reach about 8 - 12 Pomodoros in a day. I find this is the amount
most people can do before you hit diminishing returns.
You keep track of these blocks using a stopwatch or timer. You can
search the web for sites like Tomato Timer or use your own.
4. I fill each day with 8 - 12 Pomodoros worth of tasks
5. I execute each task on those days
I also move tasks around as I see fit. Sometimes I’ll finish tasks
quicker. And sometimes tasks take a bit longer than I planned.
It doesn't have to be rigid and perfect.
The point is to have a plan for the week.
Now let’s move onto the next part...
Part 2: Set rules for how you work
I’ve created a few rules so I stay on track and don’t get distracted...
1. When I wake up, I don't touch my phone’s apps. I don't scroll
through social media. I don’t check emails. I don't answer
messages
I get up and execute my morning routine. People can wait, the world
isn't going to end if I don't answer slack for 30 minutes.
2. I don't get to play games, watch TV, or socialize until I finish 8 -
12 Pomodoros for the day
This can also apply if you’re in a 9 to 5 position. Just set your work
tasks up with the Pomodoro method. And same if you have your own
business.
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|25

You see, if you break tasks down into Pomodoros (Pomodori) a couple
things will happen...
Instead of taking all day to do tasks... you’ll finish them much faster.
The timer adds an element of urgency.
Which is Parkinson's Law. Simply put, we tend to finish tasks by how
much time we allot to it.
Want to finish your task so you can go drinking with the boys in 30
minutes?
It will happen.
But if you have all day to do it... you’ll take the whole day to finish the
task...
It’s like summer homework. Everyone always does them the week
before summer vacation ends.
And the next reason why this works so well — is because you’ll figure
out how long tasks should take to finish.
Oh I have to write a QA report?
It should only take me 2 Pomodoros. I can squeeze this in before the
next meeting.
It only takes me 2 Pomodoros to do a full workout? Yes, I can fit this in
during lunch break.
It only takes me 2 Pomodoros to write a blog post? I can do this
before dinner.
See how tasks become much easier and faster to manage this way.
Simple right?
Now do it.
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|26

Take Action:
● Use Kanbanflow/Excel and plan out your week
● Break down tasks into Pomodoros
● Try an information diet (delay until you’ve done all tasks).
● Put your focus fully into Pomodoros sessions
● Put your phone in another room. Close all your excess tabs.
Lock your door. Ignore slack until you're done
● Fight the urge to watch videos or check the news — it will be
there after you’re done

DO LESS TO MAXIMIZE YOUR
PRODUCTIVITY
Your greatest enemy will always be...
Yourself.
It’s not going to be forces we can’t control. Like the weather or the
market
It’s not going to be your parents or your teachers.
And it’s not going to be some mystic entity — keeping you back.
It’s always going to be you.
And half the time we won’t even be conscious of it...
You see, we all make bad judgement calls.
You do it. Your parents do it. Your favorite celebrity does it.
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|27

And of course — I even do it.
I’ve been in the same situation... I know how it feels.
After a long day of coding and meetings... you’re just too tired to drag
yourself to the gym.
And you’re too tired to make a full meal for yourself. Or work on your
own business. Or study extra chapters and get ahead.
All you really want to do is relax and enjoy a movie. Order a pizza and
down a gallon of sugar water (soda).
Then watch YouTube until you eventually fall asleep in your comfy
bed.
I get it, it’s easier and faster.
But unfortunately this is what most people default to. This is how most
people get stuck. And wake up one day wondering...
“HOW DID IT GET THIS BAD? IT WASN’T SUPPOSED
TO GO THIS WAY... I HAD BIG DREAMS I WANTED
TO ACCOMPLISH. WHERE DID I GO WRONG?”
You see, most of the time —  we have good intentions. And we try to
do the right thing.
But at the end of the day — you can’t 100% trust yourself.
And what I mean is... you can’t trust your motivations, feelings or rely
on willpower.
These things change way too often... and this is why we second
guess ourselves.
I’m willing to bet you have days where you wake up and you’re ready
to take on the world...
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|28

You crush task after task and feel proud you did a lot. If everyday is
like this one — you’ll become successful in no time at all.
You’ve never been so productive in your life...
But then you’ll have days where it’s a complete 180.
Where you’ll hit snooze over and over again — and it’s a drag to even
leave your bed. It drains you to even think about work for the day. And
you feel like doing nothing.
(Which makes you feel bad and guilty — and you enter a downward
spiral)
Your productivity drops and you’re back to square one all over again.
So like I said above... emotions, feelings and motivations WILL
change on a whim.
You can’t trust them.
So how do you keep your productivity high?
You create less and less judgement calls. And In other words... make
less decisions...
YOU CAN’T MAKE BAD JUDGEMENT CALLS — IF
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE JUDGEMENTS
(Big brain thinking right here)
And here’s how to do it with what I call my two hats method...
Part 1: The first hat is the Manager Hat.
You put on this hat at the start of your week (or end of the week). And
you plan out the whole week.
Peak Performance Habits For Software Developers|29

You pre-make decisions before you have
to make them.
(I recommend you use the Kanbanflow
and pomodoro method to plan your
weeks)
At the end of the week — you evaluate the
results and make adjustments.
You’ll start to get a feel of what is possible and what isn’t. And over
time you’ll start to optimize your weeks for max efficiency.
Do this every week and you’ll never have to wonder...
“What should I do today?”
Think of it like a RTS (real time strategy) game.
Your objective is to destroy the enemy base with your own units.
So what's your plan of attack?
OK, Monday I need to gather resources for my base.
Tuesday, I’ll create some offensive units.
Wednesday, I’ll upgrade my units with cool armor.
Thursday, I’ll create some ships to transport them.
Friday, I’ll send them over to attack.
So here’s your plan of attack. You know what to do now.
You’re not going to distract yourself with other tasks...
You’re not going to create a big wall and hide behind it. You’re not
going to try and do a cheese rush tactic.

You’re going to follow the plan and
this leads into my next hat...
Part 2: The second hat is the
Worker Hat.
This one is pretty straightforward...
When you put on the worker hat — all
you do is execute the plan.
You don't complain about it.
You don't try to change it.
You do the work until the week is over.
And yes, sometimes the plan will suck. Especially when you don't
know how long things should take.
But stick with it and trust the process.
So after the week is finished... you put on your manager hat again —
and repeat this process.
This is how you’ll finish task after task — and get to where you want to
go faster.
And this is exactly how I get more done than the average developer...
Now it’s your turn.
Take Action:
● Remember, your worst enemy is yourself
● Put on your Manager Hat and plan out your week
● Put on your Worker Hat and execute the plan
● Modify the plan and apply this habit to more areas of your life
● Add more tasks when you’re comfortable

LET GO OF ALL EXPECTATIONS
This is a big one for software developers and most people in general.
And this could be the most important section you ever read.
I’m not exaggerating... this goes beyond tactics or principles.
This is something to live by and will greatly improve your
productivity/life.
You see, as developers we often hang our happiness and well being
on things we have no control over.
For example... I know people who get sad — when it’s not sunny
outside.
Or they get seriously pissed off — because their manager did
soemthing really stupid.
Or they are physically angry — because someone on their team can’t
solve a basic problem.
And these things drastically affect their productivity.
But do you know what’s helped me achieve peace of mind?
And helped me do more/better work
consistently?
I let it all go... I have no
expectations.

Now let me address why this is important... And before you start
saying...
“Oh no, here’s the woo-woo part of John coming out. What’s next...
numbers are energy and all you have to do is wish for more money?”
Funny, but there’s no weird woo-woo nonsense to what I’m about to
share with you...
You see, expectations cause you to suffer and pushes you away from
accepting reality as it is.
You’re hanging on to ideals and notions of how things “should be.”
Which doesn’t work at all...
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR LIFE TO BE SUBJECT TO
THINGS YOU CAN’T CONTROL
Well, unless you enjoy chaos and a rollercoaster of bad emotions...
For example... Let's say you expect your project manager to be
competent and know exactly what he’s doing.
Well, If you’ve ever worked under anyone... you know this is never the
case.
But guess what... Your boss is human.
He/she makes mistakes. And you never know what’s going on in their
lives.
Maybe their dog died the other day.
Maybe their kids hate themt.
Perhaps they got into the position by accident.
Or maybe they're close friends with the CEO.

You never know...
So there’s no point trying to change your boss. There’s no point
expecting anything from them.
There’s no point arguing or trying to fight them on every detail.
They’re not going to change much.
Everything is the way it is.
So instead of focusing on how bad your boss is... suck it up and get
your resume ready.
Or get as much experience as you can — so you can move on.
If it’s in your control... act on it.
If it’s not in your control... let it go....
EXPECTATIONS ALSO CAUSE RESENTMENT
And can block genuine feelings...
For example... when you expect someone to do a task for you. And
you know they don’t want to do it.
Well, it’s going to cause a lot of tension for the both of you.
The person isn’t going to perform at their very best. And why would
they?
If they don’t want to do it... they’re just going to do the bare minimum.
And you won't get the results you need.
So you’ll be bitter and angry at them.
You’ll start to think why didn’t they do it this way. Why did they have to
screw it up like this...

This is what happens when someone doesn't meet your expectations.
Now let’s reverse this scenario...
Think of a time where you were in charge of a project. The boss says
you can handle this challenge however you like...
He’s not expecting anything — but wants to see what you’re made of.
Weren’t you excited?
You’d think of many ways to tackle the challenge. You were
enthusiastic and didn’t complain.
You’d think about it constantly. Even before you go to bed. So
naturally — you knock this project out of the ballpark.
And this is because there’s no expectation or obligation.
So let it all go...
I know this is way easier said than done...
SO HERE’S MY 7 QUICK STEPS ON HOW LET GO OF
ALL EXPECTATIONS.
1. I want you to think about what IS in your control. And this
includes your thoughts and your actions
2. Figure out what expectation is creating negative emotions
3. Ask yourself... is this expectation reasonable?
4. Accept ALL outcomes. Even the “bad” ones
5. Realize having people do what THEY want is genuinely better
than doing what YOU want

6. Replace your expectations with standards. If they don't meet
your standards — you can move on.
7. Remember people are like NPCs (non player characters in a
video game). They all have their own scripts and programs to
execute.
And there you have it...
A brief explanation of how to let go of all expectations.
Seriously... this will take some time.
But once you get to my level... where you have no expectations.
It’s like a whole different life.
The more you let go... the more your life will change.
People will flock to you and WANT to work for you.
You’ll stand out in a world where everyone is bitter and cynical.
You’ll be in full control over your emotions. No more outbursts and bad
reactions.

And you’ll get more done with less stress.
It’s a weird superpower to have.
But it’s worth it.
Take Action:
● When you feel angry or sad about an expectation. Stop for a
moment and trace where it comes from
● Let go of that expectation with the 7 steps above
● Get into the habit of letting more expectations go
● Practice gratitude for what you already have

WAIT... BEFORE YOU GO
If you made it this far... you’re on the right path.
When you execute and do what’s written above. You’ll be leagues
ahead of everyone else.
But to be honest with you... this is just the beginning.
I’m sure you have more questions and need help in other areas of
your life...
If a resource like this could solve all your problems in one go... I’d be
out of business tomorrow.
But you’re in luck... over the next few weeks. I’ll be sending you more
resources to help you accelerate your career.
